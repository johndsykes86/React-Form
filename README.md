# React form
Just a simple form component designed in React, nothing terribly fancy about it.

I'm getting used to the flow of data collection from a form in React. The form doesn't send data anywhere on the internet, just saves the data to state (under this.state.formData) after submission, displays the data that was sent under the form element once its been submitted and then empties the input fields.

Currently, there's no validation on the form so you can pass on blank information. I'll work on that a little later.

That's it.
