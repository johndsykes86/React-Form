# React form
Just a simple form component designed in React, nothing terribly fancy about it. Just getting used to the flow of data collection from a form in React. The form doesn't send data anywhere, just saves the data to state (under this.state.formData) after submission, displays the data that was sent under the form element and then empties the input fields.  

That's it.
